RISC-V is an open-standard, free, and extensible instruction set architecture (ISA) designed for computing platforms. Unlike proprietary ISAs like x86 and ARM, RISC-V is open-source, allowing anyone to develop processors based on it without licensing fees. Example of CPU following this architecture is the ATMega328 (Commonly used for Arduino boards)
